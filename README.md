## Popular C# Repositories on GitHub

### Utilizing C# and Vue.js, and whatever other frameworks/libraries you feel most comfortable with, complete the following: 

1. Clone this repository. https://github.com/QuaverBusinessSystems/QuaverEd-Vue-App.git

2. Using the GitHub API, retrieve the top 100 most starred public C# projects and store the list of repositories in a MySQL table. The application must be able to create a new schema and table if they do not already exist. The table must contain the repository ID, name, owner username, URL, created date, last push date, description, and number of stars. This process should also be able to update existing project details. 

3. Using the data in the table created in step 1, create an interface that displays a list of the GitHub repositories and allows the user to click through to view details on each one. Be sure to include all of the fields in step 1 â€“ displayed in either the list or detailed view. For the interface, utilize Vue.js and Bootstrap 5. You can also use any other additional libraries you want.

4. Be sure to publish your code to a public GitHub repository and make commits to show and document your process. Create a README file with a description of the architecture chosen and notes on installation of the application - and make sure to upload it to your GitHub repository.
